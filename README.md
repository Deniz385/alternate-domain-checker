Domain Availability Checker
This project is a simple web application that checks the availability of a domain name.
The domain name entered through the user interface is sent to a PHP backend script, and the result is dynamically displayed on the screen.

üöÄ Project Purpose
This tool was developed to provide a basic example of how to retrieve data from an external service using web scraping and internal API emulation methods, without a need for an official API.

üìÇ File Structure
The project consists of two main files:

index.html: The frontend file where the user enters the domain name and sees the results. It contains a simple HTML structure, 
CSS for styling, and JavaScript code to handle communication with the server.

check_domain.php: Contains the main backend logic. This PHP script:

Receives the domain name request from index.html.

Sends a cURL request to internal check-availability service.

Adds necessary headers and cookies to mimic a request coming from a real browser.

Sends the result back to index.html.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Usage
